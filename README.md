# MyWeather
MyWeather lets you know the weather of any location across the globe. It not only tells you the current weather (cloudy, humid, rain, etc.) and temperature, but also gives you the information about what the temperature feels like, what the windspeed is, the region you are looking at and its latitude and longitude. All it needs to fetch this information for you is a click on the map.
